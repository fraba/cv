\section{Research}

\begin{boxH}

\begin{itemize}

\item I have \textbf{eight years of experience as an academic researcher} in \textbf{computational social science}, \textbf{digital political communication}, and \textbf{platform governance}, combining rigorous quantitative methods with substantive questions about how \textbf{digital technologies reshape democratic participation}.

\item I have secured over \textbf{AU\$672,000} in competitive research funding as Chief Investigator.

\item My research integrates \textbf{computational methods} (\textbf{network analysis}, \textbf{natural language processing}, \textbf{spatial analysis}) with traditional social science approaches to examine how \textbf{digital platforms} and \textbf{AI technologies} reshape \textbf{political participation}, \textbf{misinformation dynamics}, and \textbf{democratic resilience} across diverse political contexts.

\item My publication record includes \textbf{14 peer-reviewed journal articles} (predominantly in Q1 journals), \textbf{2 books}, and \textbf{11 news articles}, complemented by \textbf{41 invited presentations at academic conferences and research seminars} and \textbf{21 media appearances}, demonstrating both scholarly impact and commitment to public engagement and knowledge translation.

\item I actively contribute to policy development through \textbf{government consultations} on \textbf{AI regulation}, expert participation in technology policy roundtables, and \textbf{media commentary} translating research into public discourse.

\end{itemize}

\section{Teaching}

\begin{boxH}
\begin{itemize}
\item I have \textbf{11 years of university teaching experience} in Australia, with proven expertise in making \textbf{computational social science methods} accessible to diverse audiences across undergraduate, postgraduate, PhD, and professional development contexts.
\item My teaching portfolio encompasses the full spectrum of \textbf{quantitative and computational method}s: \textbf{statistical and data analysis}, \textbf{research design}, \textbf{digital methods}, \textbf{data visualisation} (R but also JASP and Tableau), \textbf{network analysis}, \textbf{natural language processing}, and programming (\textbf{Python} and \textbf{R}), delivered through innovative pedagogical approaches including \textbf{Jupyter Notebooks} and active \textbf{learning strategies}.
\item I have extensive experience \textbf{coordinating large courses} (up to 300 students), \textbf{recruiting and training teaching assistants}, and implementing technology-enhanced learning that has resulted in recognition through the\textbf{ 2023 Teaching Innovation Award} and the highest year-on-year increase in student satisfaction within my School.
\item I hold the Italian scientific qualification ("\textbf{Abilitazione Scientifica Nazionale}") as Associate Professor for the disciplinary fields of \textbf{14/A2 - Political Science} and \textbf{14/C2 - Sociology of Culture and Communication} (valid until 03/10/2033), demonstrating readiness for Associate Professor responsibilities in the Italian higher education system and commitment to European academic integration.
